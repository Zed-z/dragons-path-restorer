- A tool that fixes errors in the Yakuza Experience site and lets you read the comic
- Fits all comic panels into single pages (instead of them being split into 8) for convenience
- Adds dark mode support and cleans up the design of the site
- Saves required sounds and images locally for 100% offline functionality

# Requirements

- Python 3, preferably added to the system PATH
- Basic file management, terminal and Python usage skills

# Setup and usage

1. Obtain and put the required files in the appropriate folders:
    - *Requires* a backed up copy of the website's files in the `data/experience` folder
        - `index.html` should be directly in the `experience` folder alongside files such as `comic-a-twist-of-fate-1`
    - *Optionally* put `edo-webfont.ttf` and `edo-webfont.woff` in the `data` folder
        - Not neccesary to view the comic, only fixes the appearance of buttons
    - The final file structure should look something like this:
        ```
        ðŸ“‚data/
        |-- ! put required files here !
        |-- ðŸ“‚experience/
        |   |--- ðŸ“‚css/...
        |   |--- ðŸ“‚js/...
        |   |--- index.html
        |   |--- comic
        |   |--- map
        |   |--- comic-a-twist-of-fate-1
        |   |--- comic-a-twist-of-fate-2
        |   |--- ...
        |-- edo-webfont.ttf
        |-- edo-webfont.woff
        ```
2. Edit the `config.py` configuration file to your liking
    - Preparing assets for offline use may take a while. If you don't need this functionality, set the `local_resources` entry to `False`
    - Set `css_tweaks` to `False` if you want to view the site exactly as it used to look, without visual tweaks and improvements
    - You should leave the other entries on their default values, unless you know what you're doing
3. Open a terminal in the main project directory
4. Install required python packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Run `python3 dp_restorer.py` to prepare files, apply fixes and launch the comic in your browser

# Notes and known issues

- This only fixes the comic, other features of the Experience site are still non-functional
- Sounds don't work consistently, sometimes you need to click around or mute and unmute to make them play
- If the site doesn't work straight away, refresh a couple of times
